# (0x05) NodeJS Basics Project

This project is a part of the Back-end curriculum and focuses on JavaScript, ES6, NodeJS, and ExpressJS. It is designed to help you gain a solid understanding of NodeJS and its related modules, allowing you to create a small HTTP server using both plain NodeJS and ExpressJS. Additionally, you will learn to work with ES6 features in NodeJS, use Nodemon for faster development, and follow coding standards with ESLint.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the need for external references:

- Running JavaScript using NodeJS.
- Using NodeJS modules effectively.
- Utilizing specific NodeJS modules for file reading.
- Accessing command line arguments and the environment using the `process` object.
- Creating a small HTTP server using plain NodeJS.
- Creating a small HTTP server using ExpressJS.
- Implementing advanced routes with ExpressJS.
- Leveraging ES6 features within NodeJS using Babel-node.
- Enhancing development productivity with Nodemon.



Feel free to dive into the project and explore the world of NodeJS and ExpressJS. Good luck with your learning journey!
